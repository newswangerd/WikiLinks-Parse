# WikiLinks-Parse

This is part of our data structures final project. It is used to  find out how links you need to click to get from one page on Wikipedia to another.

Our full report can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwJo0xeqmvZmZUQ0YUhwbF9GN1U/view

The files in this repo contain the parsing system that we created to pull all of the links out of Wikipedia and store them in a SQLite database to be used by WikiLinks Search.
